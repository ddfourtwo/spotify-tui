# Spotify TUI

*WARNING*: the owner of the spotify-tui organization, wael444, does not know
any rust, and has simply applied patches taken from the unmaintained spotify-tui 
repositroy made by Rigellute.

A Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12150276/75177190-91d4ab00-572d-11ea-80bd-c5e28c7b17ad.gif)

The terminal in the demo above is using the [Rigel theme](https://rigel.netlify.com/).

## Installation

The binary executable is `spt`.

### Homebrew

For both macOS and Linux

```bash
brew install spotify-tui
```

To update, run

```bash
brew upgrade spotify-tui
```

### AUR

For those on Arch Linux you can find the package on AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spotify-tui/). If however you're using an AUR helper you can install directly from that, for example (in the case of [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)), run

```bash
yay -S spotify-tui
```

### Nix

Available as the package `spotify-tui`. To install run:

```bash
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.spotify-tui
```

Where `nixpkgs` is the channel name in your configuration. For a more up-to-date installation, use the unstable channel.
It is also possible to add the package to `environment.systemPackages` (for NixOS), or `home.packages` when using [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager).

### Void Linux

Available on the official repositories. To install, run

```bash
sudo xbps-install -Su spotify-tui
```

### Fedora/CentOS

Available on the [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/spotify-tui/) repositories. To install, run

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable atim/spotify-tui -y && sudo dnf install spotify-tui
```

### Cargo

Use this option if your architecture is not supported by the pre-built binaries found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases).

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (using the recommended `rustup` installation method) and then

```bash
cargo install spotify-tui
```

This method will build the binary from source.

To update, run the same command again.

#### Note on Linux

For compilation on Linux the development packages for `libssl` are required.
For basic installation instructions, see [install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic).
In order to locate dependencies, the compilation also requires `pkg-config` to be installed.

If you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you'll need to [install additional dependencies](#windows-subsystem-for-linux).

### Windows 10

#### Scoop installer

First, make sure scoop installer is on your windows box, for instruction please visit [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh)

Then open powershell and run following two commands:

```bash
scoop bucket add scoop-bucket https://github.com/Rigellute/scoop-bucket
scoop install spotify-tui
```

After that program is available as: `spt` or `spt.exe`

### Manual

1. Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/releases) for your OS.
1. `cd` to the file you just downloaded and unzip
1. `cd` to `spotify-tui` and run with `./spt`

## Connecting to Spotify‚Äôs API

`spotify-tui` needs to connect to Spotify‚Äôs API in order to find music by
name, play tracks etc.

Instructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.

But here they are again:

1. Go to the [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
1. Click `Create an app`
    - You now can see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
1. Now click `Edit Settings`
1. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the Redirect URIs
1. Scroll down and click `Save`
1. You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!
1. Go back to the terminal
1. Run `spt`
1. Enter your `Client ID`
1. Enter your `Client Secret`
1. Press enter to confirm the default port (8888) or enter a custom port
1. You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.
1. After accepting the permissions, you'll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well, the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you're done. If the local webserver fails for some reason you'll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like "Connection Refused" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal.

And now you are ready to use the `spotify-tui` üéâ

You can edit the config at anytime at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/client.yml`.

## Usage

The binary is named `spt`.

Running `spt` with no arguments will bring up the UI. Press `?` to bring up a help menu that shows currently implemented key events and their actions.
There is also a CLI that is able to do most of the stuff the UI does. Use `spt --help` to learn more.

Here are some example to get you excited.
```
spt --completions zsh # Prints shell completions for zsh to stdout (bash, power-shell and more are supported)

spt play --name "Your Playlist" --playlist --random # Plays a random song from "Your Playlist"
spt play --name "A cool song" --track # Plays 'A cool song'

spt playback --like --shuffle # Likes the current song and toggles shuffle mode
spt playback --toggle # Plays/pauses the current playback

spt list --liked --limit 50 # See your liked songs (50 is the max limit)

# Looks for 'An even cooler song' and gives you the '{name} from {album}' of up to 30 matches
spt search "An even cooler song" --tracks --format "%t from %b" --limit 30
```

# Configuration

A configuration file is located at `${HOME}/.config/spotify-tui/config.yml`,
(not to be confused with client.yml which handles spotify authentication)

The following is a sample config.yml file:

```yaml
# Sample config file

# The theme colours can be an rgb string of the form "255, 255, 255" or a string that references the colours from your terminal theme: Reset, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, Gray, DarkGray, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow, LightBlue, LightMagenta, LightCyan, White.
theme:
  active: Cyan # current playing song in list
  banner: LightCyan # the "spotify-tui" banner on launch
  error_border: Red # error dialog border
  error_text: LightRed # error message text (e.g. "Spotify API reported error 404")
  hint: Yellow # hint text in errors
  hovered: Magenta # hovered pane border
  inactive: Gray # borders of inactive panes
  playbar_background: Black # background of progress bar
  playbar_progress: LightCyan # filled-in part of the progress bar
  playbar_progress_text: Cyan # song length and time played/left indicator in the progress bar
  playbar_text: White # artist name in player pane
  selected: LightCyan # a) selected pane border, b) hovered item in list, & c) track title in player
  text: "255, 255, 255" # text in panes
  header: White # header text in panes (e.g. 'Title', 'Artist', etc.)

behavior:
  seek_milliseconds: 5000
  volume_increment: 10
  # The lower the number the higher the "frames per second". You can decrease this number so that the audio visualisation is smoother but this can be expensive!
  tick_rate_milliseconds: 250
  # Enable text emphasis (typically italic/bold text styling). Disabling this might be important if the terminal config is otherwise restricted and rendering text escapes interferes with the UI.
  enable_text_emphasis: true
  # Controls whether to show a loading indicator in the top right of the UI whenever communicating with Spotify API
  show_loading_indicator: true
  # Disables the responsive layout that makes the search bar smaller on bigger
  # screens and enforces a wide search bar
  enforce_wide_search_bar: false
  # Determines the text icon to display next to "liked" Spotify items, such as
  # liked songs and albums, or followed artists. Can be any length string.
  # These icons require a patched nerd font.
  liked_icon: ‚ô•
  shuffle_icon: üîÄ
  repeat_track_icon: üîÇ
  repeat_context_icon: üîÅ
  playing_icon: ‚ñ∂
  paused_icon: ‚è∏
  # Sets the window title to "spt - Spotify TUI" via ANSI escape code.
  set_window_title: true

keybindings:
  # Key stroke can be used if it only uses two keys:
  # ctrl-q works,
  # ctrl-alt-q doesn't.
  back: "ctrl-q"

  jump_to_album: "a"

  # Shift modifiers use a capital letter (also applies with other modifier keys
  # like ctrl-A)
  jump_to_artist_album: "A"

  manage_devices: "d"
  decrease_volume: "-"
  increase_volume: "+"
  toggle_playback: " "
  seek_backwards: "<"
  seek_forwards: ">"
  next_track: "n"
  previous_track: "p"
  copy_song_url: "c"
  copy_album_url: "C"
  help: "?"
  shuffle: "ctrl-s"
  repeat: "r"
  search: "/"
  audio_analysis: "v"
  jump_to_context: "o"
  basic_view: "B"
  add_item_to_queue: "z"
```

## Limitations

This app uses the [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) from Spotify, which doesn't handle streaming itself. So you'll need either an official Spotify client open or a lighter weight alternative such as [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd).

If you want to play tracks, Spotify requires that you have a Premium account.

## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)

Follow the [spotifyd documentation](https://spotifyd.github.io/spotifyd) to get set up.

After that there is not much to it.

1. Start running the spotifyd daemon.
1. Start up `spt`
1. Press `d` to go to the device selection menu and the spotifyd "device" should be there - if not check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)

## Libraries used

- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify)

## Development

1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [Install `xorg-dev`](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard#prerequisites) (required for clipboard support)
1. Clone or fork this repo and `cd` to it
1. And then `cargo run`

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

You might get a linking error. If so, you'll probably need to install additional dependencies required by the clipboard package

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y -qq pkg-config libssl-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
```

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!

## Roadmap

The goal is to eventually implement almost every Spotify feature.

### High-level requirements yet to be implemented

- Add songs to a playlist
- Be able to scroll through result pages in every view

This table shows all that is possible with the Spotify API, what is implemented already, and whether that is essential.
